# Next Task Workflow

This workflow reads the TASKS.md file and helps you start working on the next incomplete task.

## Steps

// turbo-all

1. Read the TASKS.md file to see all tasks and their current status
2. Identify the next task that needs to be completed (look for tasks marked as "Not Started" or "In Progress")
3. Review the task requirements and any dependencies
4. Start implementing the task following the project's coding standards and guidelines
5. Update the task status in TASKS.md as you progress (In Progress → Completed)
6. Test the implementation to ensure it works correctly
7. When the task is complete, use the /commit-task workflow to commit your changes

## Notes

- Always check for dependencies before starting a task
- Follow the branding guidelines in BRANDING_GUIDE.md
